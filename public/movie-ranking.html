<p>Sometimes , you’re so sick of something and it seems so tacky that you don’t even want to look at it,<br /> but the only people in the world who can protect me are “my people”. <br />People who I’m used to and I’m comfortable with, people who have been my people for a long time,<br /> are people who you cannot help but love.<br /> We cannot help loving them.” <br />– Jung Hwan</p>
